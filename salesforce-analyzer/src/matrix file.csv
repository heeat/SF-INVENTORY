Categorize Semantic Model Records with Bucket Columns (Beta),,,Analytics,Data Cloud Reports and Dashboards,,TRUE,,,,"Organize data in a semantic data model into groups without the hassle of creating a formula or custom field.

Enable Secure Redirection for Flows (Release Update),,,Salesforce Flow,Flow Builder,Flow and Process Release Updates,,,TRUE,,"To protect your users and network, apply stricter validation to the flow URL parameter that determines where you redirect users after they complete a screen flow. With stricter validation, Salesforce blocks requests to redirect users to URLs that don’t meet the additional validation requirements unless they’re on your list of trusted URLs in Setup.

Enforce Permission Requirements Defined on Built-In Apex Classes Used as Inputs (Release Update),,,Salesforce Flow,Flow Builder,Flow and Process Release Updates,,,TRUE,,"This update enables permission requirements to be enforced for built-in Apex classes that are used as inputs for Apex actions. It also guarantees that the affected Apex action operates within the current component context. Currently, Apex actions rely on the previous component context.

Evaluate Criteria Based on Original Record Values in Process Builder (Release Update),,,Salesforce Flow,Flow Builder,Flow and Process Release Updates,,,TRUE,,This update fixes a bug with the evaluation criteria in processes that have multiple criteria and a record update.

Restrict User Access to Run Flows (Release Update),,,Salesforce Flow,Flow Builder,Flow and Process Release Updates,,,TRUE,,"This update was first made available in Winter ’24 and was scheduled to be enforced in Winter ’25, but we postponed the enforcement to Winter ’26. With this update enabled, Salesforce restricts a user’s ability to run a flow. A user must be granted the correct profile or permission set to run the flow. When enabled, this release update deprecates the FlowSites org permission, which gave all users in the org access to run any flow. With this update, flows run more securely because only users who are granted correct profiles or permission sets can run flows. Salesforce postponed the enforcement to allow additional time for admins to test and prepare for the change. There is no impact to admins who already enabled the update. We appreciate your adoption of this change.",,

Use Multi-Factor Authentication for Password Reset,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,TRUE,,,,"To help users be more successful in resetting their passwords, users now verify their identity using their registered multi-factor authentication (MFA) method. This change simplifies password reset for users by giving them a familiar verification process that they already use frequently for login.

Password Reset Link Stays Valid After Multiple Clicks,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,TRUE,,,,"Spend less time helping users reset their passwords. Users can now click the link in the password reset email multiple times. Previously, if a user accidentally clicked the link but didn’t complete password reset, the link became invalidated.

Issue JSON Web Token (JWT)-Based Access Tokens in Hybrid OAuth Flows,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,,,TRUE,,"To improve compatibility with external systems, issue JSON Web Token (JWT)-based access tokens instead of opaque tokens in hybrid OAuth 2.0 flows. JWT-based access tokens can be a better option when you have a variety of third-party services and you want a Salesforce token that works with all of them. By introspecting JWT-based tokens locally, avoid repeated callouts to Salesforce endpoints, which can slow performance. This change applies to the hybrid web server flow and hybrid refresh token flow. JWT-based access tokens aren’t supported for the hybrid user-agent flow.",,
Manage Sessions Associated with JSON Web Token (JWT)-Based Access Tokens,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,,TRUE,,,"JSON Web Token (JWT)-based access tokens are now backed by sessions, making them easier to manage.

Enjoy Usability Improvements for Token Exchange Setup,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,,TRUE,,,"We made some minor improvements to the Token Exchange Handlers page in Setup. We updated the text of the confirmation modal that displays when you remove an app from a token exchange handler.

Integrate Single Sign-On Service Providers with the External Client Apps Framework,,,"Security, Identity, and Privacy",Identity and Access Management,,,,TRUE,,"Use the external client apps framework, a new generation of the connected apps framework, to configure Salesforce as a SAML single sign-on (SSO) identity provider.
